ssh -Y USERNAME@XXX.computecanada.ca (XXX -> cluster you decide to use: beluga, cedar, graham, narval) 
#first login = asks for permision, say yes to add to repertoire.
#Enter the same password as the website login

#####How to visualize files on the server#####

#####How to install or use programs#####
#You can always go to the bioconda website and download programs. Always remember to install them in their separate conda environments (see section on this).
#To see what module/programs are available (some programs are already on the compute canada cloud, you only need to load it to use it)
module avail

#####USING THE COMPUTE CANADA SERVER#####
#STEP 1 : transferring the data to the Compute Canada server
#Download Filezilla and open the application. Once open, enter the same info as to log in to the server with the terminal (see above).
#The left window is usually your personal screen, and the right screen is the server screen. Find your directory and drag files from one window to another. 

#STEP 2: Make sure the files are in the proper directory by checking the terminal
# the command "cd" makes you change the directory and move as if you were clicking on files with your mouse
# the command "ls" lists all the files within the directory
# the command "pwd" lets you know the full path of your directory
