#####USING THE COMPUTE CANADA SERVER#####
#STEP 1 : transferring the data to the Compute Canada server
#Download Filezilla/WinSCP and open the application. Once open, enter the same info as to log in to the server with the terminal (see above).
#The left window is usually your personal screen, and the right screen is the server screen. Find your directory and drag files from one window to another. 

#STEP 2: Make sure the files are in the proper directory by checking the terminal
# the command "cd" makes you change the directory and move as if you were clicking on files with your mouse
# the command "ls" lists all the files within the directory
# the command "pwd" lets you know the full path of your directory
