# Metagenomics_ComputeCanada
Compilation of codes related to the analyses of metagenomes on the Compute Canada cluster

These codes have been compiled and optimized over the years to successfully obtain MAGs from environmental samples. In no way are those codes proprietary and references should be employed when using those resources.
